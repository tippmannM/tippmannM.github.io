	<h1>How Design Works</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
			<p>The two websites are <a href="http://thru-you-too.com" target="blank">http://thru-you-too.com</a> and <a href="http://www.samdallyn.co.uk/"target="blank">http://www.samdallyn.co.uk/</a>.</p>
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
			<p>Thru you too is extremely clean with a very clear focal point with the video being central and covering the whole page. It has a minimal menu, which is easy to find and navigate. As you move your mouse on the page you are immediately prompted to use different navigational options. Negative space is used very effectively on sub pages.</p>
			<p>Sam Dallyn's site does not have a focal point and allows the work to shine. It utilizes a flexibly grid to show are variety of work, but is cohesive using a primarily back and white color scheme.</p>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>The two sites are simliar in that they are minimalistic and utilize simple naviagation. Sam Dallyn's design has a strong grid, while Thru you too uses more of a single column design. Their user experience and goals are also very different.</p>
		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>This thumbnail shows a simple one column image based portfolio site. It has a very minimalistic homepage with a single scroll down call to action.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tippmannM/tippmannM.github.io/Build-your-design/unit.two/wireframe_one_column.jpg"></li>
				<li>This thumbnail is a three column site that incorporates the use of white space and multiple images. The three menu squares would incorporate rollover text seen here.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tippmannM/tippmannM.github.io/Build-your-design/unit.two/wireframe_two.jpg"></ul>
